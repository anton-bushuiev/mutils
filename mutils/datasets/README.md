# Data

## SKEMPI2

SKEMPI v2.0 is the standard dataset of protein binding ddG annotations. It contains roughly 100 unique PPIs and 6000 labeled mutations.

## 7FAE

7FAE is a dataset of mutations in a human antibody with respect to its binding affinity
towards the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It contains saturated 494 single-point mutations on the interface, where 5 of the mutations are annotated as stabilizing and the effects of the others are unknown.
